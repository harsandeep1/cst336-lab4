            <p>This is the first planet in the Solar System and closest to the Sun. 
            The surface of this planet looks like Earth's moon. This is also the smallest 
            planet in the Solar system, and it orbits the Sun in approximately 88 earth 
            days. In the past, two satellites have been launched towards Mercury. 
            Another satellite was launched in 2018, and it is estimated to arrive at 
            Mercury in 2015. </p>
